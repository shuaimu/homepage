<h2 id="lab-3a-persistence-for-raft-server">Lab 3A: Persistence for Raft Server</h2>

<p>If a Raft-based server reboots it should resume service where it left off. This requires that Raft keep a persistent state that survives a reboot. The paper’s Figure 2 mentions which state should be persistent.</p>

<p>A real implementation would write Raft’s persistent state to disk each time it changed, and would read the state from disk when restarting after a reboot. Your implementation won’t use the disk; instead, it will save and restore persistent state from a Persister object (see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">raft/persister.h</code>). The RaftServer constructor supplies a Persister object that initially holds Raft’s most recently persisted state (if any). Raft should initialize its state from that Persister, and should use it to save its persistent state each time the state changes. Use the Persister’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadRaftState()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SaveRaftState()</code> methods.</p>

<p>Complete the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shutdown()</code> in server.cc by adding any code required to perform a graceful shutdown of RaftServer.</p>

<p>Complete the functions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Persist()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadPersist()</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">raft/server.cc</code> by adding code to save and restore persistent state. You will need to encode (or “serialize”) the state as Marshallable in order to pass it to the Persister. Refer to the sample implementation of MultiStringMarshallable in kv/server.h and kv/server.cc to create a custom Marshallable class. You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MarshallDeputy::CMD_STATE</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MarshallDeputy::CMD_SNAPSHOT</code> (for part 3b) as Marshallable kind for the new classes you create.</p>

<p>Insert calls to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Persist()</code> at the points where your implementation changes the persistent state. Insert calls to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadPersist()</code> to reload the stored state when RaftServer reboots. Once you’ve done these, and if the rest of your implementation is correct, you should pass all of the persistence tests.</p>

<p>The tests for lab 3a uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/raft_lab_test.yml</code></p>

<p>NOTE : For grading only tests 12 to 14 count. But the sanity of tests 1-11 are important.</p>

<h2 id="lab-3b-log-compaction-for-kv-server">Lab 3B: Log Compaction for KV Server</h2>

<p>In Lab 3a you implemented Raft’s persistence feature. As things stand now with your lab code, a rebooting server replays the complete Raft log in order to restore its state. However, it’s not practical for a long-running server to remember the complete Raft log forever. Instead, you’ll modify Raft and kvserver to cooperate to save space: from time to time kvserver will persistently store a “snapshot” of its current state, and Raft will discard log entries that precede the snapshot. When a server restarts (or falls far behind the leader and must catch up), the server first installs a snapshot and then replays log entries from after the point at which the snapshot was created. Section 7 of the extended Raft paper outlines the scheme; you will have to design the details.</p>

<p>You should spend some time figuring out what the interface will be between your Raft library and your KV service so that your Raft library can discard log entries. Think about how your Raft will operate while storing only the tail of the log, and how it will discard old log entries. You should discard them in a way that allows a garbage collector to free and re-use the memory; this requires that there be no reachable references (pointers) to the discarded log entries.</p>

<p>The tester passes maxraftstate to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StartKVServer()</code>. maxraftstate indicates the maximum allowed size of your persistent Raft state in bytes (including the log, but not including snapshots).</p>

<p>You should compare maxraftstate to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">persister.RaftStateSize()</code>. Whenever your key/value server detects that the Raft state size is approaching this threshold, it should save a snapshot, and tell the Raft library that it has been snapshotted, so that Raft can discard old log entries. If maxraftstate is 0, you do not have to snapshot.</p>

<p>Your RaftServer probably keeps the entire log in a list which is indexed. Modify it so that it can be given a log index, discard the entries before that index, and continue operating while storing only log entries after that index. Make sure you pass all the Raft tests after making these changes.</p>

<p>Modify your kvserver so that it detects when the persisted Raft state grows too large, and then hands a snapshot to Raft and tells Raft that it can discard old log entries. Raft should save each snapshot with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">persister.SaveSnapshot()</code> (don’t use files). A kvserver instance should restore the snapshot from the persister when it re-starts.</p>

<p>You can test your Raft and kvserver’s ability to operate with a trimmed log, and its ability to re-start from the combination of a kvserver snapshot and persisted Raft state, by running the Lab 3A tests while artificially setting maxraftstate to 1.</p>

<p>Think about when a kvserver should snapshot its state and what should be included in the snapshot. Raft must store each snapshot in the persister object using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SaveStateAndSnapshot()</code>, along with corresponding Raft state. You can read the latest stored snapshot using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadSnapshot()</code>.</p>

<p>Your kvserver must be able to detect duplicate operations in the log across checkpoints, so any state you are using to detect them must be included in the snapshots.</p>

<p>You are allowed to add methods to your Raft so that kvserver can manage the process of trimming the Raft log and manage kvserver snapshots.</p>

<p>Modify your Raft leader code to send an InstallSnapshot RPC to a follower when the leader has discarded the log entries the follower needs. When a follower receives an InstallSnapshot RPC, your Raft code will need to send the included snapshot to its kvserver. (Hint: The callback for InstallSnapshot should return a snapshot to the KVServer)</p>

<p>The maxraftstate limit applies to the GOB-encoded bytes your Raft passes to persister.SaveRaftState().</p>

<p>You should send the entire snapshot in a single InstallSnapshot RPC. You do not have to implement Figure 13’s offset mechanism for splitting up the snapshot.</p>

<p>Make sure you pass TestSnapshotRPC before moving onto the other Snapshot test.</p>

<p>NOTE : For grading only tests 9 and 10 count. But the sanity of tests 1-8 are important.</p>

<h2 id="lab-3c-sharded-data-store">Lab 3C: Sharded Data Store</h2>

<p>In this part you’ll build a key/value storage system that “shards,” or partitions, the keys over a set of replica groups. A shard is a subset of the key/value pairs; for example, all the keys starting with “a” might be one shard, all the keys starting with “b” another, etc. The reason for sharding is performance. Each replica group handles puts and gets for just a few of the shards, and the groups operate in parallel; thus total system throughput (puts and gets per unit time) increases in proportion to the number of groups.</p>

<p>Your sharded key/value store will have two main components. First, a set of replica groups. Each replica group is responsible for a subset of the shards. A replica consists of a handful of servers that use Raft to replicate the group’s shards. The second component is the “shard master”. The shard master decides which replica group should serve each shard; this information is called the configuration. The configuration changes over time. Clients consult the shard master in order to find the replica group for a key, and replica groups consult the master in order to find out what shards to serve. There is a single shard master for the whole system, implemented as a fault-tolerant service using Raft.</p>

<p>A sharded storage system must be able to shift shards among replica groups. One reason is that some groups may become more loaded than others, so that shards need to be moved to balance the load. Another reason is that replica groups may join and leave the system: new replica groups may be added to increase capacity, or existing replica groups may be taken offline for repair or retirement.</p>

<p>The main challenge in this lab will be handling reconfiguration – changes in the assignment of shards to groups. Within a single replica group, all group members must agree on when a reconfiguration occurs relative to client Put/Append/Get requests. For example, a Put may arrive at about the same time as a reconfiguration that causes the replica group to stop being responsible for the shard holding the Put’s key. All replicas in the group must agree on whether the Put occurred before or after the reconfiguration. If before, the Put should take effect and the new owner of the shard will see its effect; if after, the Put won’t take effect and client must re-try at the new owner. The recommended approach is to have each replica group use Raft to log not just the sequence of Puts, Appends, and Gets but also the sequence of reconfigurations. You will need to ensure that at most one replica group is serving requests for each shard at any one time.</p>

<p>Reconfiguration also requires interaction among the replica groups. For example, in configuration 10 group G1 may be responsible for shard S1. In configuration 11, group G2 may be responsible for shard S1. During the reconfiguration from 10 to 11, G1 and G2 must use RPC to move the contents of shard S1 (the key/value pairs) from G1 to G2.</p>

<p>Only RPC may be used for interaction among clients and servers. For example, different instances of your server are not allowed to share global variables or files.</p>

<p>This lab uses “configuration” to refer to the assignment of shards to replica groups. This is not the same as Raft cluster membership changes. You don’t have to implement Raft cluster membership changes.</p>

<p>This lab’s general architecture (a configuration service and a set of replica groups) follows the same general pattern as Flat Datacenter Storage, BigTable, Spanner, FAWN, Apache HBase, Rosebud, Spinnaker, and many others. These systems differ in many details from this lab, though, and are also typically more sophisticated and capable. For example, the lab doesn’t evolve the sets of peers in each Raft group; its data and query models are very simple; and handoff of shards is slow and doesn’t allow concurrent client access.</p>

<!-- Your Lab 3 sharded server, Lab 3 shard master, and Lab 2 kvraft must all use the same Raft implementation. You may change your Raft implementation as needed.  -->

<!-- ### Part A: The Shard Master  -->

<p>We supply you with skeleton code and tests in <tt>src/shardmaster</tt>.</p>

<p>To get up and running, execute the following commands:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git checkout -b lab-shard-solution
$ git fetch --all
$ git rebase upstream/lab-shard-23 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The shardmaster manages a sequence of numbered configurations. Each configuration describes a set of replica groups and an assignment of shards to replica groups. Whenever this assignment needs to change, the shard master creates a new configuration with the new assignment. Key/value clients and servers contact the shardmaster when they want to know the current (or a past) configuration.</p>

<p>Your implementation must support the RPC interface described in <tt>shardmaster/service.h</tt>, which consists of <tt>Join</tt>, <tt>Leave</tt>, <tt>Move</tt>, and <tt>Query</tt> RPCs. These RPCs are intended to allow an administrator (and the tests) to control the shardmaster: to add new replica groups, to eliminate replica groups, and to move shards between replica groups. The return code <tt>ret</tt> is similar to what you have in the kv lab: KV_SUCCESS, KV_TIMEOUT, KV_NOTLEADER.</p>

<p>The <tt>Join</tt> RPC is used by an administrator to add new replica groups. Its argument is a set of mappings from unique, non-zero replica group identifiers (GIDs) to lists of server names. The shardmaster should react by creating a new configuration that includes the new replica groups. The new configuration should divide the shards as evenly as possible among the full set of groups, and should move as few shards as possible to achieve that goal. The shardmaster should allow re-use of a GID if it’s not part of the current configuration (i.e. a GID should be allowed to Join, then Leave, then Join again).</p>

<p>The <tt>Leave</tt> RPC’s argument is a list of GIDs of previously joined groups. The shardmaster should create a new configuration that does not include those groups, and that assigns those groups’ shards to the remaining groups. The new configuration should divide the shards as evenly as possible among the groups, and should move as few shards as possible to achieve that goal.</p>

<p>The <tt>Move</tt> RPC’s arguments are a shard number and a GID. The shardmaster should create a new configuration in which the shard is assigned to the group. The purpose of <tt>Move</tt> is to allow us to test your software. A <tt>Join</tt> or <tt>Leave</tt> following a <tt>Move</tt> will likely un-do the <tt>Move</tt>, since <tt>Join</tt> and <tt>Leave</tt> re-balance.</p>

<p>The <tt>Query</tt> RPC’s argument is a configuration number. The shardmaster replies with the configuration that has that number. If the number is -1 or bigger than the biggest known configuration number, the shardmaster should reply with the latest configuration. The result of <tt>Query(-1)</tt> should reflect every <tt>Join</tt>, <tt>Leave</tt>, or <tt>Move</tt> RPC that the shardmaster finished handling before it received the <tt>Query(-1)</tt> RPC.</p>

<p>The very first configuration should be numbered zero. It should contain no groups, and all shards should be assigned to GID zero (an invalid GID). The next configuration (created in response to a <tt>Join</tt> RPC) should be numbered 1. There will usually be significantly more shards than groups (i.e., each group will serve more than one shard), in order that load can be shifted at a fairly fine granularity.</p>

<p>Tip: You may want to serialize a simple data structure into a string; <tt>std::stringstream</tt> and <tt>boost::serialization (archive)</tt> may come in handy. The compiling script is ready for you to use them (library linking is added). If you want to use other means of serialization, make sure they are header-only, i.e., you cannot use heavy serialization libraries like ProtoBuf.</p>

</div> -->

<p>Now you’ll build shardkv, a sharded fault-tolerant key/value storage system. You’ll modify files in the <tt>shardkv</tt> directory.</p>

<p>Each shardkv server operates as part of a replica group. Each replica group serves <tt>Get</tt>, <tt>Put</tt>, and <tt>Append</tt> operations for some of the key-space shards. The system uses <tt>Key2Shard()</tt> to find which shard a key belongs to. Multiple replica groups cooperate to serve the complete set of shards. A single instance of the <tt>shardmaster</tt> service assigns shards to replica groups; when this assignment changes, replica groups have to hand off shards to each other, while ensuring that clients do not see inconsistent responses.</p>

<p>Your storage system must provide a linearizable interface to applications that use its client interface. That is, completed application calls to the <tt>Get()</tt>, <tt>Put()</tt>, <tt>Append()</tt> methods must appear to have affected all replicas in the same order. A <tt>Get()</tt> should see the value written by the most recent <tt>Put</tt>/<tt>Append</tt> to the same key. This must be true even when <tt>Get</tt>s and <tt>Put</tt>s arrive at about the same time as configuration changes.</p>

<p>Each of your shards is only required to make progress when a majority of servers in the shard’s Raft replica group is alive and can talk to each other, and can talk to a majority of the <tt>shardmaster</tt> servers. Your implementation must operate (serve requests and be able to re-configure as needed) even if a minority of servers in some replica group(s) are dead, temporarily unavailable, or slow.</p>

<p>A shardkv server is a member of only a single replica group. The set of servers in a given replica group will never change.</p>

<p>You will need to modify code in the client that sends each RPC to the replica group responsible for the RPC’s key. It re-tries if the replica group says it is not responsible for the key; in that case, the client code asks the shard master for the latest configuration and tries again. 
<!-- You'll have to modify the client as part of your support for dealing with duplicate client RPCs, much as in the kvraft lab. --></p>

<p>Your server should not call the shard master’s <tt>Join()</tt> handler. The tester will call <tt>Join()</tt> when appropriate.</p>

<p>Your first task is to pass the very first shardkv test. In this test, there is only a single assignment of shards, so your code should be very similar to that of the kv-lab. The biggest modification will be to have your server detect when a configuration happens and start accepting requests whose keys match shards that it now owns.</p>

<p>Now that your solution works for the static sharding case, it’s time to tackle the problem of configuration changes. You will need to make your servers watch for configuration changes, and when one is detected, to start the shard migration process. If a replica group loses a shard, it must stop serving requests to keys in that shard immediately, and start migrating the data for that shard to the replica group that is taking over ownership. If a replica group gains a shard, it needs to wait for the previous owner to send over the old shard data before accepting requests for that shard.</p>

<p>Implement shard migration during configuration changes. Make sure that all servers in a replica group do the migration at the same point in the sequence of operations they execute, so that they all either accept or reject concurrent client requests.</p>

<p>Your server will need to periodically poll the shardmaster to learn about new configurations. The tests expect that your code polls roughly every 100 milliseconds; more often is OK, but much less often may cause problems.</p>

<p>When you’re done your code should pass all the shardkv tests other than the challenge tests:</p>
